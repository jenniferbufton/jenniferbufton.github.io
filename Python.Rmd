This is a an app developed in Python and hosted on `streamlit.io`. It was created to inform funding decisions - and for targeted communications to organisations in flooded areas - for Sport England's Flood Relief funding programme.

The app calls the Environment Agency for live funding data (including the polygons of the flooded areas) to enable plotting using `Folium`.
