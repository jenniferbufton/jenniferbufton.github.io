<h1>About Leaflet</h1>
<p>The <code>Leaflet</code> package creates a map widget; you can add layers such as tiles, markers, and polygons to build up the map. There is already a fantastic guide for using <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/">Leaflet</a>, but here is a quick overview on how to create a simple map, using data from British Cycling via the <a href="%22http://api.letsride.co.uk/public/v1/rides%22">Open Active API</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="load-the-library" class="section level1">
<h1>Load the Library</h1>
<p>All we need to create the map is a dataset with longitude and latitude (which we have from the Open Active API) and the <code>Leaflet</code> package.</p>
