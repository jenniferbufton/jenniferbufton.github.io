This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to reading in a shapefile and joining it with a dataset to create a dataframe which we can then visualise. 


# Introduction
You will need: </p>
a) The data you want to map </p>
b) A shapefile. See [here](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/shapefiles.htm) for more information about shapefiles.</p>


The aim is to join the shapefile with the data you wish to map, and then convert it from spatial data into a dataframe. In order to join the data, you will need to have a variable common to both the dataset and the shapefile (e.g. a Local Authority code).

In this example, we are going to use Active Lives Survey data from the Sport England Active Lives dataset (datasets available on the [UK Data Archive](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/#!?Search=active%20lives%20survey&Page=1&Rows=10&Sort=1&DateFrom=440&DateTo=2019)). This data goes down to a Local Authority level (England only). 
</br>

We will use the shapefile from [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/45a1aaed-503a-4259-bd3e-27ce2ddc7b16/local-authority-districts-december-2016-super-generalised-clipped-boundaries-in-the-uk). This contains data beyond our interest (i.e. beyond England) so we will need to do a bit of data cleaning once we have created our joined dataframe.

</br>

# Load packages
```{r package, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)# for ggplot
library(broom) # to put shapefile into a dataframe format
library(geogrid) #reading and cleaning
```

</br>

# Read in the ShapeFile
Read in a shapefile with the `read_polygons` function from `geogrid`.

```{r shp, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
LAD_shp <- read_polygons(file.shp) #file.shp is an LA boundary shapefile from ONS: Local_Authority_Districts_April_2019_Boundaries_UK_BUC.shp

kable(LAD_shp[1,]) %>% # show first line of data
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered",
                position = "left", font_size = 12)  

```

</br>

# Read in the data
Read in the data you want to plot, and merge it with the spatial data, using the common column (Local Authority code).
```{r df, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

df <- df %>% # Active Lives data
  select('lad19cd', 'Male.Active') # choose LA code for join and also colmn with data to plot


LAD_shp_data <- sp::merge(LAD_shp, #join shape and data
                          df,
                          by.x="lad19cd",
                          by.y="lad19cd",
                          duplicateGeoms=T,
                          all.x=F)
```

</br>

# Clean the data
Create a 'clean' function to create a usable dataframe for plotting - by using `tidy` - and apply this custom function to our shapefile. 
```{r clean, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
clean <- function(shape){
  shape@data$id = rownames(shape@data)
  shape.points = tidy(shape, region="id") #converts to dataframe
  shape.df = inner_join(shape.points, shape@data, by="id")
}

# Apply function to shapefile
LAD_shp_data_tidy <- clean(LAD_shp_data)

# here we can include only England by specifying only LAs with an "E" in the code are retained.
LAD_shp_data_tidy <- LAD_shp_data_tidy[grep("E", LAD_shp_data_tidy$lad19cd),]

kable(LAD_shp_data_tidy[1,]) %>% # show first line of joined data
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered",
              position = "left", font_size = 12) 
```

We now have a dataframe that we can use to make beautiful maps! See the other tutorials for guides on how to visualise this geospatial data in `R`.

# The `sf` package
It is also possible to read in json files with the `sf` package using `sf::st_read` to read in the data, and plot with `sf_geom` and `sf_geom_label`. The [Mapshaper](https://mapshaper.org/) site is an excellent resource for altering file formats and simplifying boundaries.
