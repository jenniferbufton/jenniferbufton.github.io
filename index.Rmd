<center><h3>Dog-whisperer, R fanatic, itinerant millenial<h3> </center>

I am a data analyst at Sport England and advocate in a slightly too intense way for more data-love in the sports sector.
</br>
I like to jog, pedal a bicycle, and watch *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade* on repeat.
</br>
This site is a collection of all things R-related that I find useful. Plus a photo of my dog. Whom I whisper to.
